/**
 * In methods annotated with {@literal @}Async calls to <code>await(future)</code>
 * will cause the method to return a CompletableFuture (or Task) instead of blocking.
 * <p/>
 * This is equivalent to use CompletableFuture composition methods (ex: thenApply, handle).
 * The advantage of using <code>await</code> is that the code will resemble sequential blocking code.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre><code>
 * import com.ea.orbit.async.Async;
 * import static com.ea.orbit.async.Await.await;
 * ...
 *
 * {@literal@}Async
 * CompletableFuture<Integer> getPageLengthAsync()
 * {
 *     CompletableFuture<String> pageFuture = getPageAsync("http://example.com");
 *     String page = await(pageFuture);
 *     return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(page.length);
 * }</code></pre>
 *
 * Or using orbit Task:
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal@}Async
 * Task CompletableFuture<Integer> getPageLengthAsync()
 * {
 *     Task<String> pageFuture = getPageAsync("http://example.com");
 *     String page = await(pageFuture);
 *     return Task.fromValue(page.length);
 * }</code></pre>
 *
 * <b>Caveat</b>: The following code must be called before the program execution:
 * {@code static { Await.init() }}
 * Otherwise, the first method to call {@code await()} might be blocking,
 * and a warning message will be printed to the console.
 * Subsequent async methods will work as expected.
